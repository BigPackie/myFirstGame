Hello everybody. 

So this is my first game created at STU FIIT on subject  Principles of Computer Graphics and Image Processing 2015.
Thx for Ing. Peter Drahos for providing support and game base code + some models and textures.
Check out his github at https://github.com/drahosp/ppgso

About this game

This game is without HUD. 
You have tree shields which get destroyed each by 1 shot.
After you have no shields, you can survive 3 more shots. After each damage taken,
your firing and moving speed is diminished and such.

Each row of your enemies are tougher and takes more shots to destroy.
The last row ships are faster as well.


Controls

LEFT, RIGHT - to move left and right
SPACE - shoot
R - reset game
UP, DOWN -	change camera angle
C - reset camera angle


Future

Maybe at a later time, damage texture will be implemented to show the damage state of your ship.
Also HUD may be implemented and more levels or a boss fight as well.



Thx, and have fun.
